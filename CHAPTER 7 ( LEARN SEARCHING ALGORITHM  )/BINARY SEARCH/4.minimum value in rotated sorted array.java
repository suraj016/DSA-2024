LEETCODE NO 153


Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5000
-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
All the integers of nums are unique.
nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.


 BRUTEFORCE APPROACH

int minElement = arr[0];  // Start with the first element as the minimum
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {  // Iterate over the rest of the array
            if (arr[i] < minElement) {
                minElement = arr[i];  // Update minElement if a smaller element is found
            }
        }
        return minElement;


  OPTIMIZED APPROACH 
  
  int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;

            //if left part is sorted:
            if (arr[low] <= arr[mid]) {
                // keep the minimum:
                ans = Math.min(ans, arr[low]);

                // Eliminate left half:
                low = mid + 1;

            } else { //if right part is sorted:

                // keep the minimum:
                ans = Math.min(ans, arr[mid]);

                // Eliminate right half:
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
